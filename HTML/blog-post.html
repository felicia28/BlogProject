                <h2>WHEN IT ALL BEGAN</h2>
                <p class="date-line"><em>January 29, 2021</em></p>
                <article class="blog-content">
                    <p>It all started in 1999, as a freshman in high school. One of my elective classes was a computer class, in which we received a crash course in HTML.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p><em>I had no idea this would be what I would be doing for the majority of my life, and what would become one of my favorite things to do in my spare time.</em></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>After exploring all of the possibilities with header tags, paragraph tags, tiled background images and animated GIFs - I was hooked. I didn't own a computer until a few years later, but when I did 90% of my free time was spent picking apart source codes of various websites with cool (for the time) features, and duplicating them on my own in Notepad. (Let me tell you, the day I discovered text editors with tabs I was ecstatic.)</p>
                    <p>Along came 2002, when I started on my Associate's degree at a local community college - where I was a HTML Teacher's Aide and JavaScript tutor. The excitement never got old, and coding felt magical.</p>
